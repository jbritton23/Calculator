# Calculator

This file like so many others is your basic calculator.  It is capable of multiplication, Division, addition, subtraction, decimals, percents and square roots.   It was the first major android app I developed.  To develop it I used the Java language running through Android studios.  For special characters such as square root I used ASCII codes to represent them.  The basic algorithm converts on screen characters into doubles by casting via the parse method. It then gets the selected operand and performs the desired operation returning the answer as a string displayed in the label on screen.  Each line of code is well documented.
